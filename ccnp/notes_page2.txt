RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)) reserve resources, this is a control protocol similar to ICMP
BFD: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) used to quickly detect failures
- 52: 
TOS field (DSCP) can both be used for classifcation and marking. 
exp: There are 4 routers. The first 1 classifcation the packet and mark to TOS field. The second found that mark, so it does not re-classification but rather use the mark to classify and send packet. This goes on.

Link Management Protocol : ensure integrity, monitor and health check SVL ( StackWise Virtual links) -> C or D, D may be
- 61: not sure
broadcast radiation (broadcast storm): the excessive amount of broadcast traffic in a network

-62: check for MTU/segment
A. TCP window size - maximum data receiver willing to take in a point in time 
B. IP MTU - Maximum Transmission Unit => set higher so no fragmentation needed
C. TCP MSS - Maximum Segment Size => set higher so no fragmentation needed
D. DF bit clear - not set this mean segmentation
E. MTU ignore - use for ospf, ignore MTU if not match, no effect
-63: 
ETR:  The ETR is the only device that publishes EID-to-RLOC mappings for a site. It publishes mappings to the Map Server
 MR/MS: Map resolver/mapserver - like a database store mapping, when get querried, it response
ITR: query the infor, not publish it
-66: 
VRF and VRF-lite: VRF is used by ISP, VRF-lite (a lightweigh VRF) used by enterprise. 
VRF can make logical routers from a physical one. If there are 2 interfaces with the same network (G0/0 - 10.0.0.0/24 and G0/1 - 10.0.0.0/24), need VRF for this (else there will be conflict)

A. Route targets control the import and export of routes into a customer routing table. - yes 
B. When BGP is configured, route targets are transmitted as BGP standard communities. - VRF-lite not using BGP
C. Route targets allow customers to be assigned overlapping addresses. - Route Distinguisher identify overlapping IPs
D. Route targets uniquely identify the customer routing table. - Route Distinguisher identify routing table

How GRE tunnel works:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytAqv7qHGyU&t=147s

Transform-set: A transform set is a combination of security protocols and algorithms. There is no transform set ACL so A is incorrect
crypto map: we dont need this for IPsec cause we have transfomr set already.

To configure IPsec over GRE, we neeD:
IPsEC Profile 
Transform-set 
Apply interface

++++
Configure ipse over gre: 
- create gre tunnel
- create phrase 1 IPSEC for nodes authentication (item 2 and 3)
- create phrase 2 IPSEC: define how data is encrypted with transform set and create IPSEC profile
- assign the profile to tunnel gre
Actual configs
! 1. Configure tunnel gre
interface Tunnel0
 Ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source 20.20.20.1
 tunnel destination 10.10.10.1
 ip mtu 1476
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1436

! 2. Configure ISAKMP (IKE) Policy for IPsec
crypto isakmp policy 10
 encryption aes
 hash sha
 authentication pre-share
 group 2
 lifetime 86400

! 3. Set Pre-shared key for peer
crypto isakmp key MySecretKey address 0.0.0.0

! 4. Define IPsec transform set
crypto ipsec transform-set MYTRANSFORM esp-aes esp-sha-hmac

! 5. Create an IPsec profile
crypto ipsec profile GRE-IPSEC-PROFILE
 set transform-set MYTRANSFORM

! 6. apply to are tunnel
interface Tunnel0
 tunnel protection ipsec profile GRE-IPSEC-PROFILE

we dont need crypto map and ACL

C - need to assign vrf to E0/0 and advertise this new vrf to ospf

#99:

Refer to the exhibit. Which configuration allows Customer2 hosts to access the FTP server of Customer1 that has the IP address of 192.168.1.200?

A.
ip route vrf Customer1 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1 global
ip route vrf Customer2 192.168.1.200 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1 global
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan10
ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan20
B.
ip route vrf Customer1 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.255 172.16.1.1 global
ip route vrf Customer2 192.168.1.200 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 global
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan10
ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan20
C.
ip route vrf Customer1 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1 Customer2
ip route vrf Customer2 192.168.1.200 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1 Customer1
D.
ip route vrf Customer1 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.1.1 Customer1
ip route vrf Customer2 192.168.1.200 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.1 Customer2

Either A and B - is correct, but A is the correct one because B only shows route to 1 IP 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.255. also, route to 182.168.1.200 255.255.255.0 is not correct

#100:
A - keep alive can be different
B is correct: tunnel destination will be known via tunnel interface means loops
C - not working
D - cannot know

- The key for B is: network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0 will advertise the destination of the tunnel through the tunnel interface itself. So to get to its destination (209.165.201.2) it goes back through the tunnel, which makes an infinite loop. 
- To avoid, there must be a static route directly between these two tunnel destinations, so ospf won't overwrite this config. (Note that the command ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.200.225 won't get prioritized) 



*** Additional note:
- Vrf route leaking to global:
+ Add to vrf routing table: ip route vrf CUST-A 30.30.30.0 255.255.255.252 30.30.30.1 global (use global to point)
+ Add to global routing table: ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 fa2/0 (only specify the interface to point to vrf, cannot use ip here)

- vrf route leaking among vrfs: vrf should be difference network, use keyword global to route leaking

Issue: The user said that the R$32.88 bonus he received was incorrect. He claimed that the bonus for the red bears should have been paid, and pointed out that the bears and the multiplier reached 512 times. He also said: "Before this round went wrong, my bonus was 26.96, plus the orange 5.92, a total of 32.88, right? So where did the red payout go?

Please verify it. Thank you
