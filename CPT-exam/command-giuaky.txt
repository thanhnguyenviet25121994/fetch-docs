give me command for this:
Create ACL 101.

o    Explicitly block FTP access to the Enterprise Web Server (192.168.1.70/29) from the internet: this should be done by blocking all FTP traffic source from Se0/1/0)


o    No ICMP traffic from the internet should be allowed to any hosts on HQ LAN 1 (192.168.1.0/26): this should be done by blocking all ICMP traffic source from Se0/1/0)

o    Allow all other traffic.

give me command on cpt:
o    Use ACL number 111

o    No hosts on HQ LAN 1(192.168.1.0/26) should be able to access the Branch Server.(192.168.2.45/28)

o    All other traffic should be permitted.

configure terminal

! Step 1: Create ACL 111
access-list 111 deny ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.63 192.168.2.45 0.0.0.15
access-list 111 permit ip any any

! Step 2: Apply ACL to the Serial0/1/1 interface (inbound)
interface Serial0/1/1
ip access-group 111 in

! (Optional) Step 3: Verify ACL
end

o    Create a named standard ACL. Use the name vty_block. The name of your ACL must match this name exactly.

o    Only addresses from the HQ LAN 2 network (192.168.1.64/29)should be able to access the VTY lines of the HQ router:

configure terminal

! Step 1: Create a named standard ACL (only permit HQ LAN 2)
ip access-list standard vty_block
 permit 192.168.1.64 0.0.0.7
exit

! Step 2: Apply it to the VTY lines
line vty 0 4
access-class vty_block in
exit

! (Optional) Step 3: Verify

o    Create a named extended ACL called branch_to_hq. The name of your ACL must match this name exactly.

o    No hosts on either of the Branch LANs (192.168.2.0/27 on G0/0/0) and (192.168.2.32/28 on G0/0/1) should be allowed to access HQ LAN 1(192.168.1.0/26). Use one access list statement for each of the Branch LANs.

o    All other traffic should be allowed.
---
enable
configure terminal

! Step 1: Create the named extended ACL "branch_to_hq"
ip access-list extended branch_to_hq

! Block traffic from Branch LAN 1 (192.168.2.0/27) to HQ LAN 1 (192.168.1.0/26)
deny ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.31 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.63

! Block traffic from Branch LAN 2 (192.168.2.32/28) to HQ LAN 1 (192.168.1.0/26)
deny ip 192.168.2.32 0.0.0.15 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.63

! Allow all other traffic
permit ip any any

! Step 2: Apply the ACL to the appropriate interfaces

! Apply the ACL to G0/0/0 (incoming direction)
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
ip access-group branch_to_hq in
exit

! Apply the ACL to G0/0/1 (incoming direction)
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
ip access-group branch_to_hq in
exit

! (Optional) Step 3: Verify the ACL
